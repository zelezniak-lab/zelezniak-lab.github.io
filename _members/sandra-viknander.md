In Zelezniak lab I have focused on integrating machine learning methods in the field of bioinformatics. A broader goal that we have is to learn the language of proteins with the help of machine learning. To reach this goal we are currently working on methods to learn specific patterns of proteins. Patterns in the proteins that code for specific functions or properties such as thermal stability or activity. We are also interested in how we can use the information that our machine learning models extract can help guide the design of new and novel proteins.

I play around with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli for synthetic functional DNA transcription or protein expression of improved properties, whose sequences are generated by AI models developed in our lab. 
Research interests: plastic biochemical degradation, microfluidics-based enzyme directed evolution, machine learning, biosensor. 
Ongoing projects: 
 - Directed evolution of PET hydrolases
 - Benchmarking of generative models for synthetic proteins
 - Thermostability improvement of enzymes
 - Protein expression optimization in yeast

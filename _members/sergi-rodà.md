I am a PhD student from the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, aiming at engineering enzymes through in silico methods. My main goal is to design new biocatalysts that can have impactful applications in different sectors of society. To design these enzymes, we mainly use structural-based modeling techniques. At the moment, I am working in Zelezniak lab to harness the power of deep learning and generative models to perform in silico bioprospecting of PET hydrolyzing enzymes.

In Zelezniak lab I am working on developing interaction prediction network to ultimately navigate proteins's amino acid sequence space towards the target protein. This Project involves adapting and testing the latest algorithms from the natural language processing field such as transformer-based models, and comparing their performance to the current state-of-the-art.

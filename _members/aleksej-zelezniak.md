Aleksej Zelezniak is an Associate Professor at the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. His lab develops and applies new machine learning strategies to facilitate the understanding of biological systems to translate the knowledge into synthetic biology and medical applications. We build mechanistic and data-driven machine learning models to learn quantitative genotype-phenotype relationships to understand molecular phenomena' underlying mechanisms in natural systems. We then apply the knowledge and test predictions in experimental settings (mainly yeast and bacteria). Prior to starting the  Genome Biology Data Science Lab in 2017,  Aleksej, as an EMBO fellow, completed his postdoctoral training at Markus Ralser Lab at the University of Cambridge and the Francis Crick Institute, London, UK. He developed methods of integrating massive proteome datasets into metabolic networks to understand the regulation of metabolism. Aleksej did his PhD under the supervision of Dr Kiran Patil at European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany. He has a Masters's Degree from the Technical University of Denmark and a Bachelor's degree from Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Lithuania.

Samuel is working with machine learning for epilepsy. He develops an algorithm utilizing register data to find the right anti-seizure medication for patients, as well as developing a machine learning method that uses EEG data to predict who will develop epilepsy after a single seizure.
Collaboration with [Prof Johan Zelano](https://www.gu.se/en/research/johan-zelano).
